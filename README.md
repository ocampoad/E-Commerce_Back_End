​
## My process
​
### Built with
​
- Node.js
- Insomnia
- Sequelize/ SQL

### What I learned
​
I was able to learn how to create tables and query using sequelize functions. Sequelize makes working with database easier. The different routes can be displayed using Insomnia which was easy and intuitive. I was also able to implement more async/await functions. 

### Continued development
​
I would like to learn more about the associations using sequelize. There are optional parameters/ callbacks within the function that would be usefull in the future. 
​
### Useful resources
​
- [Sequelize documentation](https://sequelize.org/) - Documentation helped me learn how to use sequelize and how to associate different tables
